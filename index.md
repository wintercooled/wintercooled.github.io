# An open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform.

## Designing, building and operating your own private blockchain is easy with Elements.

An Elements based blockchain can operate as a stand alone blockchain or be pegged to another, enabling assets to be verifiably transferred between two different blockchains. 
Elements allows you to issue multiple different types of asset on a single blockchain, opening up many new use cases for implementation.
 
Using Elements to create your own blockchain allows you to harness the features and new technologies that are being developed by other members of the Elements community. This can reduce internal development and research costs and enables you to explore new applications of blockchain solutions and technologies in a time effective manner.

#### If you are developer you might find it easier to start with the [Elements Code Tutorial]({{ site.url }}/elements-code-tutorial) - which explains some of the key features of Elements as you learn how to use it.

### The features and benefits of using Elements

|Features|Benefits|
|--------|--------|
|    Asset Issuance: multiple types of asset can be issued and transferred between network participants.|    Secured by a federation of parties with aligned incentives.|
|    Confidential Transactions: allows transaction amounts and asset types to be private between transacting parties.|    Leverages the security of the Bitcoin codebase, allowing it to be extended with innovative new features.|
|    Flexible Configuration: Elements can operate as a stand-alone blockchain or as a sidechain, where assets are pegged to another blockchain.|    No risk of blockchain reorganisations with rapid finality of transactions.|
|    Schnorr Signatures: improved efficiency of transaction validation. New and compact modes of multi-signature.|    Advanced transaction privacy for both value and asset type transacted.|
|     Federated, two-way peg: allow cross-chain transactions to be constructed in a decentralized fashion with assets that can be moved across blockchains.|    Can be pegged to assets on other blockchains, allowing interoperability between chains.|
|    Signed Blocks: block creation through multi-party signature retains decentralized properties while decreasing transaction confirmation times and preventing reorganisations.|    Configurable set up, public testnet and open source code lets you experiment with different security models and features created by other members of the community.|

### Elements extends Bitcoin's code and features

Extending and building upon Bitcoin's code allows developers familiar with the bitcoind API to quickly and cost effectively create working blockchains and test proof-of-concept projects. It also allows Elements to function as a test-bed for changes to the Bitcoin protocol itself. 

The Elements test network is called Elements Alpha and functions as a sidechain to Bitcoinâ€™s testnet. It serves as a technology demo and testing environment, making it easy for the community to jointly test the latest features being added to Elements. It also provides a way for developers to contribute their own Elements for community review, helping to improve and extend the Elements project and acting as a reliable way to test proposed changes to Bitcoin itself.

### Elements adds the following features that are not available in Bitcoin
* Confidential Assets
* Confidential Transactions
* Additional opcodes
* Federated 2-way Peg
* Signed Blocks

### Previous elements that have been integrated into Bitcoin
* Segregated Witness
* Relative Lock Time

### Elements deferred for additional research and standardization
* Schnorr Signatures
